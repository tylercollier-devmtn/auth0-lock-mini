# Project Summary

In this project, we'll use a service called Auth0 to do the heavy lifting of auth for us, including allowing for social integrations (github, google, etc). We'll build a site that looks similar to the [auth-bcrypt-mini](https://github.com/tylercollier-devmtn/auth-bcrypt-mini) project but does not store any sensitive data in our tables.

## Setup

* `Fork` and `clone` this repository.
* `cd` into the project directory.
* Run `yarn`. You know to use yarn instead of npm because there is a `yarn.lock` file.
* Create a Postgres database. Use this project's `db/init.sql` file to create the schema.
* Copy the `env.example` file to a new file called `.env` and paste in the connection string to the postgres database. Later, we'll fill out your Auth0 domain and client ID.
* Start the server with `nodemon`.
* Start the web dev server with `npm start`. In your browser, open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Step 1

### Summary

In this step, we'll go to `manage.auth0.com` to create an account. We'll create a 'client' that represents this particular app.

### Instructions

* Go to `manage.auth0.com`.
* Register for an account.
  * Set the account type to `Personal`.
  * Set the role to `Developer`.
  * Set the project to `Just playing around`.
* Log in to your Auth0 account.
* Go to `Clients` using the left navigation bar.
* Click the `Create Client` button in the top right.
  * Pick a name (recommendation: `auth0-lock-mini`)
  * Change the `Client Type` to `Single Page Web Applications`.
  * Click Create.
  * Switch to the client's `Settings` tab.
  * Change the `Allowed Callback URLs` to `http://localhost:3000`.
  * Scroll toward the bottom and click the `Show Advanced Settings`, and switch to the OAuth tab. Change the `OIDC Conformant` toggle to off.
* Click `Save Changes`.
* Back at the top of the settings, copy the domain and client ID to your project's `.env` file. Be sure to restart your React web dev server to use these values.
* On the Auth0 website, click on Connections on the left hand side navigation, and then Social.
  * Enable the Github connection.

## Step 2

### Summary

In this step, we'll add the Auth0 Lock library to the React website and initialize it.

### Instructions

* First add the `auth0-lock` library with `yarn add auth0-lock`.
* Open the `src/App.js` file.
* In the `constructor`:
  * set state for `user` and `secureDataResponse` to `null`.
  * Set a member property named `lock` to `null`.
* Add a `componentDidMount()` method:
  * Set `this.lock` to equal `new Auth0Lock()`, and pass in your client ID and domain, using the environment variables from `process.env.<ENV VAR NAME HERE>`.
  * Add a handler to Lock's `authenticated` event using `this.lock.on(...)`. The handler should be a prototype method named `onAuthenticated`. We'll fill out that method in the next step.
  * Make an axios GET request to `/user-data`. Use the response data to set the React user state.
    * If there is no response data, set the React user state to `null`. By setting the state to null instead of `undefined`, the displayed user state will show as the word "null" instead of blank.

### Solution

<details>
<summary><code>App.js</code></summary>

```js
import Auth0Lock from 'auth0-lock';

class App extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      user: null,
      secureDataResponse: null
    };
    this.lock = null;
    this.logout = this.logout.bind(this);
    this.fetchSecureData = this.fetchSecureData.bind(this);
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.lock = new Auth0Lock(process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID, process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN);
    this.lock.on('authenticated', this.onAuthenticated);
    axios.get('/user-data').then(response => {
      this.setState({ user: response.data.user || null });
    });
  }
```
</details>

## Step 3

### Summary

In this step, we'll add a handler for when someone clicks the Log in button, and handle when authentication has happened on the client side.

### Instructions

* Open the `src/App.js` file.
* Bind the `onAuthenticated` prototype method in the constructor.
* In the previous step, we set up the handler for `this.lock.on('authenticated')`. Create that method.
  * It should take in a variable named `authResult`.
  * In the method, make an axios POST to `/login`. Send as the body an object with a property named `idToken`. The value should be the `idToken` from `authResult`.
* Add a `login` prototype method.
  * Show the Lock screen with `this.lock.show()`.
  * Bind the `login` prototype method in the constructor. 

### Solution

<details>
<summary><code>App.js</code></summary>

```js
class App extends Component {
  constructor() {
    // ...
    this.login = this.login.bind(this);
    this.onAuthenticated = this.onAuthenticated.bind(this);
  }
  
  // ...

  onAuthenticated(authResult) {
    axios.post('/login', { idToken: authResult.idToken} ).then(response => {
      this.setState({ user: response.data.user });
    })
  };

  login() {
    this.lock.show();
  };
```
</details>

## Step 4

### Summary

In this step, we'll handle the authentication on the server side.

### Instructions

* Open the `server/index.js` file.
* Navigate to the code for the `/login` endpoint.
* Destructure the `idToken` value from the request body.
* Construct a variable named `auth0Url` that looks like this: `https://<YOUR AUTH0 DOMAIN>/tokeninfo`. Use `process.env.<ENV VARIABLE NAME HERE>` to get the domain.
* Make an axios POST to that URL, sending the id token in a property called `id_token`.
    * First, put a `.catch()` on that call. If there's an error, it likely represents an invalid login. Simply return a 500 with a message.
    * The response data will include a property called `user_id`. Use that and `db/find_user_by_auth0_id.sql` to look up the user in the database.
    * If a user is found, create a `user` object on the session that is that user object from the database, and send back a response with that user in a property called `user`.
    * If the user is not found, it means they have never logged in before. This is conceptually a "register" situation. Use the `user_id` and `email` field from the response to create a user record. The `db/create_user.sql` file will be helpful for this.
      * After the record has been created, put the user object on the session in a property named `user`, and send back a response with that user in a property called `user`.

### Solution

<details>
<summary><code>server/index.js</code></summary>

```js
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  const { idToken } = req.body;
  const auth0Url = 'https://' + process.env.REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN + '/tokeninfo';
  axios.post(auth0Url, { id_token: idToken }).then(response => {
    const userData = response.data;
    app.get('db').find_user_by_auth0_id(userData.user_id).then(users => {
      if (users.length) {
        req.session.user = users[0];
        res.json({ user: req.session.user });
      } else {
        app.get('db').create_user([userData.user_id, userData.email]).then((newUsers) => {
          req.session.user = newUsers[0];
          res.json({ user: req.session.user });
        })
      }
    })
  }).catch(error => {
    console.log('error A', error);
    res.status(500).json({ message: "An error occurred; for security reasons it can't be disclosed" });
  });
});
```
